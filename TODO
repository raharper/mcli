- Fix Machine.name and Machine.Config.Name fields should be the same
- Implement network subcommand to display configured networks
- Implement default user networking between two VMs on one vmport
- Auto-allocate hostport and configure hostfwd of guest ssh port
- Implement machine ssh subcommand which queries VMs host port and invokes ssh
with --port flag
- Implement machined launching in unshare namespace to allow machined to create
bridged networking and use passt/pasta to egress to host network.
- Handle client failure to connect to server gracefully
- Possibly implement an index in the LIST output so one can use the index or the
  name of the VM to interact with the machines (this is like virsh)
